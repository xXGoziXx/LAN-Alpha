<h3>The Note-Taking App, that actually makes you better at LoL</h3>
<b>League Active Notes (aka LAN)</b>, is the League of Legends Overwolf App that actively helps you take notes <b>while</b> playing the game.<br>
<br> The <b>aim</b> of this app is to encourage players to note down their mistakes, so that they don't keep making them.<br>
<br> Taking notes helps you realize where you're going wrong. This is awesome because it means you're <i>actually</i> learning something about the game every match and therefore getting better at it. <u>This applies to both pros and casual plebs because we <b>ALL</b> make mistakes</u>.<br>
<br>
<b>LAN</b> allows you to quickly note down the mistakes you made, that caused you to die. It does this by popping up on the screen, so you can note down what to do next time to prevent that mistake. You can right down as many as you want, before you respawn.<br>
<br> In addition to this you can also switch to the <u>Death Tips</u> or <u>Overview</u> tab to view your previous tips. At the end of the game, all your tips can be viewed in the app.<br>
<br> (
<b>A side-effect I also noticed is that, it stops you from flaming right after you die, since your keyboard focuses on the app when it pops up</b>).<br>
<br> Tips can be deleted. You know... in case you become pro and don't need them <b>:P</b>
<br>
